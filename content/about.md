I'm Siddharth, an Indian computer scientist based in the UK. I'm passionate about fields mainly at the intersection of theoretical computer science, mathematics, and art. My research and applied interests include intuitionist type-theory (MLTT), computer graphics, and computational optimization. 

I worked as an audio engineer with news and communications organizations before pivoting to game development during my undergraduate studies which ultimately led me to computer science. I'm passionate about learning and often obsess over any and every new thing I encounter. Okay, _most_ new things.

My hobbies include reading, painting with watercolours, making music, programming soundscapes on my synthesizers. Weather permitting, I'll even whip out my telescope and go stargazing.

I'm available over at [email](mailto:hi@siddharths.space).
