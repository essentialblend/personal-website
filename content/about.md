Hi, I'm Siddharth. I'm a highly motivated Indian computer scientist currently based in the UK, specializing in the intersection of theoretical computer science and pure mathematics. My research at the university for my MS focused on developing machine-verified proofs within a framework called Intuitionistic Type Theory. 

Before that, I was an audio engineer at GTPL Hathway. I then transitioned to game development for my undergraduate studies, which ultimately led me to computer science.

Academically, my recent focus has centered around catching up on various fundamental sciences, mainly mathematics and physics which I catalog [here](/notes/) and revisiting primary interests like computer graphics, especially offline rendering. I'm extremely passionate about learning and devote significant amounts of time obsessing over every new thing I come across. Okay, _most_ new things.

In my free time, I either paint in watercolours, make music, program otherwordly soundscapes on my synthesizers, or if weather permits, whip out my telescope and look at the stars. Weather here _rarely_ permits, though.

I'm available at ambiverb@gmail.com.
