Hi, I'm Siddharth, an Indian computer scientist currently based in the UK. In March 2024, I completed my MSc in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham, where my research focused on developing machine-verified proofs within intuitionistic type theory.

Earlier, I worked as an audio engineer with various organizations before pivoting to game development during my undergraduate studies which ultimately led me to computer science.

Academically, I’m catching up on fundamental sciences — primarily mathematics and physics which I catalog [here](/notes/). I'm extremely passionate about learning and often obsess over any and every new thing I encounter. Okay, _most_ new things.

I paint with watercolours, make music, program soundscapes on my synthesizers. Weather permitting, I'll even whip out my telescope and go stargazing. Sadly, the British skies rarely oblige.

Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:hi@siddharths.space).
