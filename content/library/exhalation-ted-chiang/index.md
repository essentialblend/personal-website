description: "From the acclaimed author of Stories of Your Life and Others — the basis for the Academy Award nominated film Arrival — comes a groundbreaking second collection of short fiction: nine stunningly original, provocative, and poignant stories. These are tales that tackle some of humanity’s oldest questions along with new quandaries that only Ted Chiang could imagine. In Exhalation, Ted Chiang addresses the most fundamental of issues — What is the nature of the universe? What does it mean to be human? — alongside others that no one else has even imagined."
