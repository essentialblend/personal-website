description: "The Watercolour Enigma is based on a practical course by artist Stephen Coates, and is designed to take the student through a process of learning rarely seen in other practical art books. By examining the basic science of watercolour including the properties of water and colour pigment, and through a series of practical, straightforward step-by-step painting exercises, budding painters will leave Stephen's book not only with a mine of watercolour knowledge but with a selection of stunning paintings they can proudly say are their own."
