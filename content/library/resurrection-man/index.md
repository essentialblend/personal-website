title: "Resurrection Man: Quantum Karma"
description: "This six-issue Prestige format series reintroduces readers to Mitch Shelley, the Resurrection Man. Originally created by Dan Abnett, Andy Lanning, and Jackson \"Butch\" Guice, Shelley is a man who has led thousands of lives, and with each death, he is resurrected with a new superpower based on his previous cause of death. After living and dying his latest life, Shelley awakes with a new purpose to go along with his latest power: saving the universe. This version of Resurrection Man must battle across time and space against a sadistic Word War II internment camp captain who has inherited a twisted version of Shelley's abilities. As the lines of cosmic order begin to blur, Mitch Shelley will literally die to save the universe, more than once."
