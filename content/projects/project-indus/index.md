### Project Details

After my first experience programming a pathtracer following Peter Shirley's series, I wanted to try my hand at writing my own engine enhancing on what I've learned and standardizing based on [PBRT](https://pbrt.org).

Indus represents that effort. My basic aim was to use everything I learned with C++ and graphics to develop a state of the art renderer.

This project is currently on-hold as I backfill on the physics, read the book and understand their codebase.
