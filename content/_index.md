<p class="intro-lead">
  I am currently seeking graduate roles in graphics and research. My focus lies at the intersection of Theoretical Computer Science, Constructive Logic, and the Observational Arts.

In March 2024, I completed my MSc in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham with Merit. My journey has been non-linear—a 7-year haze through audio engineering and medical uncertainty—landing firmly in the precise world of formal systems.

Currently, my days are split between two distinct modes of thought:

- **Formalization:** Building a proper foundation in Type Theory. I recently moved from "naive" proofs in Agda to self-studying Mileti's *Modern Mathematical Logic*.
- **Graphics:** Working on a state-of-the-art path tracer to better understand light transport.
- **The Arts:** Painting in watercolour, reading philosophy, and making music.

This space serves as a digital garden for these pursuits. It is imperfect, recursive, and always under construction.
