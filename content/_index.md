### STATUS

- _Updated April 2025._
- In March 2024, I completed my MSc in Computer Science at the University of Nottingham and am seeking graduate roles in graphics, research, or related fields. I’m based in the UK.
- My research focused on the intersection of theoretical computer science and pure mathematics, developing computer‑aided proofs within a constructive reasoning framework. 
- I’m passionate about computer graphics and working on a PBRT‑style path tracer (currently on hold).
- Recently, I’ve been reading, painting, and making music in my free time.
- Find me on [github](https://github.com/essentialblend), [twitter](https://x.com/essentialblend).
