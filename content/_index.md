### FOCUS

Exploring the foundations of mathematical modeling and computational physics. Current goal: build up the fundamental stack required for physically based rendering and simulation engines.

- Currently working through **[Apostol: Calculus Vol. 1](https://example.com)** to tighten my grip on rigorous integration techniques.

- Slowly absorbing **Aluffiâ€™s _Algebra: Notes from the Underground_** to develop abstract fluency in algebraic structures.

### RECENT

Most of my time recently has gone into building this site from scratch using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a CSS system inspired by [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/).
