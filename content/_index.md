### STATUS

- I graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Nottingham in March '24, and on the lookout for graduate roles in graphics, research, or any relevant opportunities. I'm presently based in the UK. Here's a [link to my CV]().
- My research was at the intersection of theoretical computer science and pure mathematics where I developed computer-aided mathematical proofs within a constructive framework.
- I'm currently working on developing a pathtracer following [PBRT](https://pbrt.org/), but it's presently on hold.
- As of late, I read, paint or make music in my off time. 
- Find me on: [github](https://github.com/essentialblend), [twitter](https://x.com/essentialblend), [lichess](https://lichess.org/essentialblend).
- _Updated April 2025._
