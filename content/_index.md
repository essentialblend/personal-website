<p class="intro-lead">
I’m Siddharth&mdash;a computer science graduate based between the UK and India. At university I worked on typetheory and proof assistants (mainly Agda and Lean), using them to formalize and verify mathematical structures. Since graduating, I’ve been focused on building a physically based renderer, <i>Indus</i> as I love computer graphics. I also write and record music, and I’m currently composing my first album. I’m looking for roles in computer graphics, research, or formal verification.

Some features I recently implemented in my engine:

- **RNG**: moved Indus from `std::mt19937` (Mersenne Twister) to PCG32. This was my first serious dive into PRNG theory. I’ll write about it soon.

- **Pixel filters**: Box and Gaussian.

- A simple analytic **coated diffuse** material. It will eventually be replaced with a more rigorous version when I implement the VolPath integrator, but still fine for a first pass. 
 
Here's how these features look in action:

On the music front, it's a complete slow-burn. Since my audio production skills are latent at best, it's best to focus on sound design, composition, and learn the hardware I have inside out so I can materialize these ideas to some degree and only then look towards production. 

The three synths I've absolutely loved learning/working with recently:

- **Korg Volca Modular**: A semi-modular west-coast synth. The sound design possibilities are immense and practically endless for such a tiny box.
- **Korg Volca Drum**: A digital perc synth best suited towards experimental sounds. It is idiosyncratic in it's duality of simultaneously being open-ended and restrained.
- **Roland S-1**: A compact flexible microsynth inspired by the SH-101 covering all subtractive synthesis duties.

Some books that I recently read/am reading:

- _Dreams of a Final Theory_&mdash;Steven Weinberg
- _The Discovery of India_&mdash;Jawaharlal Nehru
- _A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century_&mdash;Upinder Singh
- _Dark Knights of Steel_&mdash;Tom Taylor and Yasmine Putri; the art is **gorgeous**
