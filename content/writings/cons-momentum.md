## 
We all intuitively sense momentum. Consider two spheres of equal volume but different masses. These spheres slide along a horizontal frictionless surface and approach a malleable wall. Upon collision, each sphere's impact yields an impression in the wall.

Assume both spheres have the same instantaneous velocity upon collision. The heavier sphere yields a deeper dent in the wall. Neither mass nor velocity independently predicts that dent; their product, a _vector quantity_ called _momentum_ $\left(\mathbf{p}\right)$, does.

Some physical quantities in nature are _invariant_: they never change as a system evolves and constituent parts interact. We say that such invariant quantities are _conserved_. Momentum is a conserved quantity in an isolated system. For example, in a car crash investigation, one need not worry about every microscopic fragment in this collision's detritus to infer the pre-impact details. Conservation laws abstract away these complex interactions to reveal crucial big-picture patterns. There are many intuitive applications of momentum conservation; prototypical examples include launching a rocket from the ground, or inferring antecedents in automobile accident analysis. We'll thoroughly explore this in the later sections.

Since this exposition presumes no mathematics or physics prerequisites, we'll first build a set of tools that enable any motivated reader to appreciate the deeper ideas behind momentum and its conservation. 

We begin with an informal discussion on fundamental intrinsic properties like mass, time, and distance. Then, we use them to derive composite quantities such as speed, velocity, and acceleration---also serving as a light conceptual introduction to differential calculus ideas. Then, we discuss Newton's three laws of motion. Finally, we'll apply these tools in a simple derivation that shows why momentum is a conserved quantity and briefly examine its consequences.
