Physics has fascinated me for years, even as the underlying mathematics often left me disinterested. I remember gazing at blackboards for hours at school, flustered, unable to grasp anything. About five years ago during my game-dev undergraduate programme, I made a brief attempt to learn calculus from a short book but failed yet again, amid other personal turmoil.

The present is a different matter. I'm slightly less clueless and understand the foundational concepts that once stumped me. I also have a metaphorical _bashed head against the wall_ to show for it. A thorough introspection on my myriad incidental educational lapses over the years hints at the _whys_. It's clear that the first domino toppled in the distant past, and all I can do is play perpetual catch-up as they topple into the future.  

The _whys_ point to two key culprits: weak motivation and poor exposition. I believe that healthy motivation makes up for subpar exposition, but subpar exposition may fail to inspire, or worse, extinguish genuine interest. Also, motivation is best nurtured, not imposed; it's born of sincere intrigue or curiosity. Motivation of this kind comes with the resolve that lets one persist through the fog of ignorance. It's this motivation that cannot be directly supplied by an author. But once motivated, expository tools are plentiful.

Why does this concern me? Setting knowledge and gratification aside for the moment, it's pedagogically unfortunate that these deeper truths are often expressed mathematically and require years of multidisciplinary exposure. This makes them inaccessible to the layperson, preventing them from truly understanding and appreciating how the world works. At best, it leaves room for superficial analogies; at worst, outright misinformation. It's imperative for those of us even slightly privileged with this knowledge to pass it on and make it accessible to everyone.

Now that I find myself needing content for my website, I'd like to pay this insight forward by explaining some ideas and using them as stepping-stones toward understanding how the universe truly works. Academic references risk losing the learner; they are often so terse that they obscure the fundamental concepts an uninitiated reader aims to grasp, which is oddly counterproductive! At the same time, they have to start _somewhere_, presume _something_. 

Now, where do we even start? I think a good, albeit conservative approach is to pick the lowest-hanging fruit: a minimal set of ideas that lets an uninitiated yet motivated learner appreciate the maximal set of natural phenomena. We're not concerned with becoming working physicists or mathematicians, nor do we care about totality, that'd be staring into the abyss. If this series succeeds even partially, it will shine a conceptual light on the deeper truths, rhymes, and patterns at the heart of nature. I want the reader to feel what I felt when careful reasoning forced unavoidable consequences---to glance at generalized abstractions, connect the dots, and reshape intuitions once held with firm conviction.
